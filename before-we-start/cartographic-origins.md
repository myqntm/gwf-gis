# Cartographic Origins

The art and science of cartography have been fundamental in shaping our understanding of our world for thousands of years. However, the creation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has revolutionized mapmaking, putting the ability to create complex maps (with larger datasets) in the hands of everyday people. This evolution brings to the forefront the critical importance of ethical considerations in map-making, especially within the realm of GIS.&#x20;

### Historical Context of Cartography

The story of cartography is a fascinating journey through human history. Ancient maps, often symbolic, were more than just tools for navigation; they were expressions of our understanding of the world. From [Babylonia’s ‘Imago Mundi’](https://www.worldhistory.org/image/526/babylonian-map-of-the-world/), the earliest known map to the ‘[Cantino Planisphere](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/history-magazine/article/cantino-planisphere-map-new-world-portugal)’, a map with many firsts but of questionable origin, each era's maps reflect its cultural, technological, and philosophical perspectives.

As European colonists ventured into uncharted waters, the need for maps that both gave direction and laid claim to land increased. This period saw the emergence of cartography as a scientific discipline in Europe with various techniques for projections, or [ways to depict the three-dimensional surface of the Earth on a flat plane](https://www.geographyrealm.com/map-projection/). However, these were not without their problems either. Maps “[secure the power of its makers](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/tale-of-three-maps/release/1)” so it’s not surprising that a map often taught in schools around the world [enlarges countries at the poles and shrinks countries near the equator](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/qmss/2022/06/14/why-your-view-of-the-world-may-be-completely-wrong/).

The 18th and early 19th centuries brought further advancements. The invention of the printing press allowed for the mass production of maps, making them more accessible to the public. This period also saw the development of topographic mapping (maps that also display elevations) and the systematic surveying of land using telescopes and other optical technologies for more accurate measurements.
