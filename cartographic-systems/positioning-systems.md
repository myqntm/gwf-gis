# Positioning Systems

GPS, or Global Positioning System, is a technology that helps determine the precise location of something on Earth. It works through a network of about 30 satellites orbiting the planet. Each satellite sends out signals that a GPS receiver, like the one in your smartphone or car, picks up. By measuring how long it takes for the signals from at least four different satellites to reach it, the GPS device can calculate its exact position. This is how your phone's map app can show you where you are, or how your car's navigation system can tell you the way to your next destination.&#x20;

### GPS Spoofing

[GPS spoofing](https://gps.stanford.edu/research/current-and-continuing-gpspnt-research/cyber-safety-transportation/anti-spoofing) is a form of hacking where a GPS signal is interfered with or manipulated to send false information about the location of the receiver. This can have serious implications for organizations relying on precise geographic data, especially in fields like environmental monitoring and advocacy. Groups may be directed to take action (or cause harm) in the wrong locations, severely impacting the efficiency of environmental justice initiatives.

### Why It Matters for Environmental Justice

For civil society organizations (CSOs) engaged in environmental justice, accurate geographic data is crucial. It can impact the reliability of data used in litigation, policy making, and community advocacy. GPS spoofing can undermine these efforts by corrupting data integrity, leading to misguided resources, and misinformed decisions.

### Common Indicators of GPS Spoofing

* **Sudden Location Shifts**: Unexpected geographical jumps that don't align with physical travel.
* **Signal Strength Fluctuations**: Sudden and inexplicable changes in GPS signal strength.
* **Known Data Inconsistencies**: Mismatches between GPS data and known facts.

{% tab title="Middle East" %}
In recent months, the Middle East has witnessed an unprecedented rise in GPS spoofing incidents.  A notable example occurred when GPS systems began erroneously positioning planes and ships hundreds of miles away from their actual locations, often pointing to Beirut's international airport.

The origins of these spoofing signals have been traced back to an Israeli airbase. This tactic, while intended as a defense measure to deter rocket and missile attacks, has led to significant disruptions in civil aviation and shipping. Aircraft and ships are compelled to disregard automated systems that rely on GPS, reverting to older navigation methods, such as visual cues and manually reported locations. This shift not only affects the efficiency of these transports but also significantly increases the risk of accidents.

**Consequences**

The implications of GPS spoofing are severe, impacting not just transportation safety but also everyday applications like ride-sharing and dating apps. For example, dating app users in Beirut have found potential matches appearing hundreds of miles away, incorrectly placed in conflict zones or neighboring countries due to spoofed locations.

**Insight**

This case highlights the dual-use nature of GPS technologyâ€”wherein a tool designed for precision and safety can be repurposed to serve strategic defense goals. It also underscores the broader ethical and safety challenges posed by the manipulation of satellite navigation systems, affecting civilians and military alike. The recent relaxation of international regulations on GPS interference for national security purposes only adds complexity to these challenges, suggesting a potentially escalating trend in GPS spoofing practices globally.

### Strategies to Mitigate GPS Spoofing

1. **Layered Data Verification**: Cross-verify GPS data with other sources like GIS databases or local knowledge to detect anomalies.
2. **Encrypted GPS Signals**: Use GPS devices that support encrypted signals, which are harder to spoof.
3. **Regular Audits and Updates**: Keep GPS devices and software regularly updated and audited for unusual activities or discrepancies.
4. **Awareness and Training**: Educate field personnel on the risks of GPS spoofing and how to recognize signs of tampering.
