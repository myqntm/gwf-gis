# Ethical Frameworks

Geographic ethical frameworks are sets of principles designed to guide the responsible use and management of geographic data. These frameworks help ensure that geospatial data is collected, used, and shared in ways that respect privacy, equity, and the rights of communities and individuals. They address ethical considerations like consent, accuracy, harm prevention, and the inclusion of marginalized groups in data narratives.

### Available Frameworks

Several organizations and bodies have developed ethical frameworks specifically tailored to geospatial data usage. As Kenneth Field writes in ‘[Ethics in Mapping](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/ethics-in-mapping/)’, there have been a few attempts to establish ethical codes to the field. This includes:

* The [British Cartographic Society](https://www.cartography.org.uk/about-us) which specifies that its members should be guided by: honesty, integrity, competence, respect and responsibility. &#x20;
* The [Mapmaker’s Mantra](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/mapmakers-mantra/) with the goal of “preserv\[ing] the authority of maps by reminding the mapmaking community of their ethical and moral responsibility to tell the truth with maps.” This mantra includes principles such as: Be honest and accurate, be transparent and accountable, minimize harm and seek to provide value, be humble and courageous.
* [EthicalGeo and its supporters](https://ethicalgeo.org/locus-charter/) have developed a proposed set of guiding principles for practitioners. These principles include: Realize opportunities, Understanding impacts, Do no harm, Protect the vulnerable, Address bias, Minimize intrusion, Minimize data, Protect privacy, Prevent identification of individuals, and Provide accountability.
* UNICEF Innocenti has also conducted research into this area and developed a [Checklist for Ethical Use of Geospatial Technologies for Evidence Generation](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/DP%202018%2002.pdf). While aimed primarily at the work they do and ensuring that their beneficiaries are protected, it provides guidance for ensuring privacy and security, understanding the risks of the platforms used, infrastructure challenges, and even engaging communities.

### **Why It Matters for Environmental Justice**

Ethical frameworks in geography are crucial for environmental justice because they ensure that geospatial data use does not harm the very communities it aims to help. These frameworks promote transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, ensuring that data collection and analysis do not inadvertently perpetuate inequalities. For instance, accurate and respectful data representation can influence policy decisions, resource allocation, and community advocacy, directly impacting environmental health and safety.

### **Guidance on Adapting a Framework for Your Own Use**

To adapt a geographic ethical framework to your organization’s use:

* **Evaluate Your Needs and Potential Challenges**: Assess the specific ethical challenges your organization faces in its geospatial work. Consider aspects such as data sources, stakeholder engagement, and the potential impacts of your data use.
* **Select Appropriate Principles**: Choose principles from existing frameworks that align with your organization's mission and the specific ethical challenges identified.
* **Customize Guidelines**: Adapt these principles into actionable guidelines tailored to your operations and contexts. This might involve setting protocols for data privacy, guidelines for community engagement, or standards for data accuracy and correction.
* **Implement Training**: Educate your team about these guidelines to ensure they are integrated into everyday practices. Regular training and updates can help address evolving ethical challenges.
* **Monitor and Iterate**: Regularly review and refine your ethical guidelines based on feedback from stakeholders and changes in technology or organizational goals.
