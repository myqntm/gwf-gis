# Data Governance

Data governance in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) context refers to the management of data availability, usability, integrity, and security within a GIS framework. It involves setting policies and procedures that govern data collection, storage, access, and usage to ensure that geographic data is handled in a transparent and accountable manner, supporting the overall objectives of the organization or project.

Shannon Dosemagen of the Open Environmental Data Project shares that while data governance models have become common in other spaces, "they are relatively underexplored in environmental and climate data...Data is a basic tool of environmental governance. Researchers, enforcement, and compliance officers need access to data to do their jobs." ([Shannon Dosemagen](https://datasciencebydesign.org/blog/role-of-climate-and-environmental-data-in-collaborative-governance))

### Mechanisms

* [**Data Trusts**:](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017801/data-trust-cybersecurity-big-tech-privacy/?truid=21520a9408c017c87cd95d7ac2d0cea5\&utm\_source=the\_download\&utm\_medium=email\&utm\_campaign=the\_download.unpaid.engagement\&utm\_term=\&utm\_content=02-24-2021\&mc\_cid=4eaa79778c) Data trusts are legal structures where a trustee manages the data rights on behalf of individuals or groups who are the beneficiaries. This governance model helps in setting clear expectations about how data is to be used and ensures that it serves the best interest of those it represents. Data trusts are often participatory and designed to facilitate representation in data usage negotiations.
* [**Data Cooperatives**](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/legal-mechanisms-data-stewardship/): These are collectives where individuals or entities voluntarily pool their data resources. The cooperative model focuses on mutual benefit and collective stewardship of data, representing a unified voice in dealings with other parties, such as companies or institutions.

### **Why It Matters**

For environmental justice, data governance, particularly through data trusts and cooperatives, plays an important role in ensuring that sensitive data is used responsibly and ethically. By managing data through these mechanisms, communities can have control over how their data is used to address environmental issues, ensuring that the data serves their needs and supports their rights.&#x20;

### **Guidance for Your Own Use**

When considering establishing a data governance framework, here are a few steps to guide your process:

* **Assess Needs and Goals**: Determine what your specific needs are in terms of data usage, including who will use the data and for what purposes. Who stands to benefit from this data? Are communities being compensated fairly to share this?
* **Establish Clear Policies**: Define clear policies regarding data access, usage, and sharing. Ensure these policies align with legal standards and ethical practices.
* **Implement with Transparency**: Operate with transparency to build trust among data providers, users, and stakeholders. Regularly review and update policies to adapt to new challenges and opportunities.
* **Engage Stakeholders**: Keep communication open between all parties involved. Ensure that stakeholders have the opportunity to provide input and feedback on how the data is managed.

"We created PLACE recognizing the need for a more inclusive, sustainable and shared model to provide the primary mapping data that is fundamental for inclusion in the digital world – a model that is not beholden to shareholder interest, but the public interest. A data trust provides for independent governance and stewardship of data separate from its creation and maintenance. Our trust will be overseen by an independent board of trustees selected for their commitment to the mission, as well as their experience and know-how related to the trust and its purpose. We believe that the most equitable and sustainable way to provide this essential infrastructure at the scale needed to make a difference is through the creation of a non-profit data trust with open membership.

Our sustainability model is based on the notion of a  [club good](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/club-goods/) serving a membership community. Each of our members agrees to a set of membership terms and conditions around the ethical use of data, and all members must be in good standing to have use of the data. In return, members have a say in how the trust is maintained and secured." ([PLACE](https://thisisplace.org/introducing-place-mapping-data-in-the-public-interest/))\

**Background:**

Malawi, like many African nations, faces challenges due to rapid population growth, strained infrastructure, and frequent climate events. Accurate and up-to-date maps are crucial for effective government services and planning. However, Malawi has not updated its comprehensive base maps since the 1970s.

#### **Challenge:**

Malawi’s outdated and fragmented mapping data impedes its ability to make informed decisions and guide investments. Traditional aerial mapping is costly and involves lengthy procurement processes. The country needed a cost-effective and efficient solution for comprehensive mapping.

#### **Solution:**

In collaboration with the Malawian government, PLACE executed a new data collection exercise in Zomba and Lilongwe. The initiative, facilitated by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Surveys, aimed to demonstrate PLACE’s model for essential mapping data. The project involved aerial and street data collection using UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and ground operations. ([Story](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2fab8e7d32c348b7b8c3cb08b6c39257))\
