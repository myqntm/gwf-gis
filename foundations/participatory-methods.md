# Participatory Methods

> ‘Place’ is defined as existing in Country that is an Australian Indigenous term encapsulating the enduring connection, respect, and caring held for ancestral lands. Country is understood to include all living and non-living entities in a meshwork of ancestral connections that weaves through place. ([Syme](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342910092\_Localizing\_landscapes\_a\_call\_for\_respectful\_design\_in\_Indigenous\_counter\_mapping))

Participatory mapping is a collaborative process where community members contribute their knowledge to create maps that reflect their spatial realities, cultural landmarks, and historical narratives. This method integrates the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to empower communities by incorporating their firsthand experiences and insights into formal mapping tools.

### Participatory GIS

Participatory GIS (PGIS) merges Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with participatory methods to involve and benefit local communities. It emphasizes community engagement, allowing members to contribute actively to the mapping and analysis of geographic data relevant to their needs and interests. This approach not only facilitates the gathering of local knowledge but also integrates it with conventional geographic data. Training community members in GIS technologies is a crucial aspect of PGIS, enhancing their capability to participate and sustain these initiatives.

However, PGIS faces challenges such as technological barriers, where limited access to technology can impede the effectiveness of projects. There's also the issue of balancing the accuracy of local knowledge with scientific data, alongside concerns about the privacy of sensitive information. Ensuring the sustainability of PGIS projects to maintain community engagement and relevance over time is another significant challenge. Additionally, "despite the benefits Indigenized digital counter mapping could bring, there always remains a risk that culturally held knowledge becomes appropriated, commodified, and subsumed by the intrinsic power of western science." ([Localizing Landscapes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342910092\_Localizing\_landscapes\_a\_call\_for\_respectful\_design\_in\_Indigenous\_counter\_mapping)).

### Why It Matters for Environmental Justice

Participatory GIS methods are crucial for environmental justice as they help to localize landscapes and challenge colonial conceptions of land and mapping. For Indigenous communities, especially, these practices respect and maintain their connection to the land as they know it.&#x20;

However, [PPGIS poses several challenges as well](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-19594-5). For example, limited access to [meaningful internet](https://www.theengineroom.org/library/ensuring-communication-for-social-justice-organisations-with-unstable-internet/) in many countries limits participation among key stakeholders. Introducing this technology into communities with limited technological literacy can be additionally challenging as these tools are often not built with these communities in mind.&#x20;

### Guidance for Your Own Use

For organizations looking to implement participatory mapping, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Engage with Respect**: Treat the local knowledge and cultural practices with the same respect as scientific data.
2. **Ensure Consent and Ownership**: Engage community consent processes and clarify data ownership and usage rights.
3. **Use Appropriate Technology**: Adapt the technological tools to the local context rather than imposing complex systems.
4. **Build Capacity**: Train community members in GIS tools to enhance their autonomy and ensure they can manage projects independently.
5. **Promote Continuous Collaboration**: Establish ongoing dialogues rather than one-off projects to truly empower communities.
