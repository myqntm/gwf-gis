# Enumeration

Enumeration in geographic terms involves the process of systematically counting and categorizing geographic units within a specific area for data collection purposes. This could mean counting the number of trees in a forest, the number of homes in a neighborhood, or any other entities that are important for a specific study or initiative.

### What is the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)?

When we gather data like population numbers or disease cases for different places, we usually organize it by areas like counties or states. However, choosing the wrong area to group your data can change what the data is telling you. This issue, known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), was highlighted in 1984 by a researcher named Openshaw. He pointed out that the areas we pick for studies are often just made up and can be changed, meaning they might not accurately reflect the actual situation. For instance, if you lump together data from different neighborhoods or regions, the way you've grouped them can change the story the data tells, making it seem like fewer people are affected in one area than there are, just because of where the boundaries were drawn ([Modifiable Areal Unit Problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/modifiable-areal-unit-problem)).

### Why It Matters for Environmental Justice

For organizations working toward environmental justice, understanding and addressing MAUP is crucial. Environmental impacts do not respect man-made boundaries, and poor enumeration strategies can misrepresent the severity and distribution of environmental issues. This misrepresentation [can lead to inadequate policy responses and resources allocation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44212-022-00021-1), disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.

### Guidance

1. **Be Consistent**: Choose a specific geographic unit size and stick with it across your analyses to maintain consistency in your data interpretation.
2. **Cross-Verify**: Test out different sizes or configurations of geographic units to cross-verify your results, which can help identify if MAUP is affecting your conclusions.
3. **Community Engagement**: Engage with local communities to understand and incorporate their insights into how geographic data is grouped and reported. Their local knowledge can provide a more accurate context for your data.

If you're in the United States:

_"ZIP codes are not appropriate for this task for many reasons, including the fact they are not actually polygons but collections of points and lines, are not designed to be uniform in population, change frequently, and do not correspond to other units of data collection, such as the census blocks/tracts. A ZIP code can cross state lines, can exist only for a building (or in the case of the NAVY boats, or in the case of the president, a single person), and do not cover the entire United States, with large numbers of people requiring a P.O. Box if the mail does not come to their house. ZIP Codes are for routing mail, not analyzing populations. The Census department tried to resolve this with the creation of the ZCTA, but these are created by committing the ecological fallacy, and a person's ZIP Code may not correspond to their ZCTA at all."_ \
